    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <p>It does not exist in real life, but it was mainly filmed on the Universal Studios backlot in California for the
        iconic movie Back to the Future.</p>
    <p>It is one of my favorite cities because that is where the memorable events of the movie with Dr. Brown and Marty
        McFly took place in each of the three films. I would love to visit that place.</p>
