        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Arturo Romero" width="200">
        <p>It is a pleasure to meet each of you. My name is Arturo Romero, and I am from Lima, Peru. I am happy for the
            opportunity to study at BYU-Idaho Online along with you and to keep progressing. I have three children, I
            got married in 2015, I served a mission in Peru Arequipa, and I have had the opportunity to serve in some
            callings in my
            ward and stake. I am currently serving as a counselor in the Elders Quorum. I like instrumental music,
            basketball,
            series, comics, and anime, but above all, I enjoy spending time with my family. At the moment, I am learning
            English
            and Portuguese.

        <p>Juli is a city located in the Puno region, on the shores of Lake Titicaca. Known as the “Little Rome of
            America” for the
            richness of its colonial temples, it combines history, tradition, and unique natural landscapes. It is an
            important
            cultural and religious destination that reflects both the Andean legacy and Spanish influence.</p>
