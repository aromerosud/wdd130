        <p>It is a pleasure to meet each of you. My name is Arturo Romero, and I am from Lima, Peru. I am happy for the
            opportunity to study at BYU-Idaho Online along with you and to keep progressing. I have three children, I
            got married in 2015, I served a mission in Peru Arequipa, and I have had the opportunity to serve in some
            callings in my
            ward and stake. I am currently serving as a counselor in the Elders Quorum. I like instrumental music,
            basketball,
            series, comics, and anime, but above all, I enjoy spending time with my family. At the moment, I am learning
            English
            and Portuguese.
